# Dear QA

A love letter from your humble UI Front End Developer.

I want to share what I've learnt from QAs/Testers and how it has helped me grow over the years. I also would like to encourage the good work of those who are already doing these things.

This 40mins talk was prepared for:
- [Wellington Testers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Testers/events/260660347/) - 9th May 2019
